This roadmap should not be taken to be 100% accurate: items on here are not necessarily confirmed. But if you see something here that interests you, by all means get in touch. It would be better to focus on things that people will definitely use.

**NOTE** this is still also very much in draft form.

#### Future

- issue #122 - create endpoint at makeTarget init 
- use SVG 'label' element for labels, instead of separate DOM element. 
- text on path
- issue #56 - allow custom shapes for perimeter anchor
- ability to edit/load flowchart connector paths
- ability to edit/load bezier / statemachine connector paths
- issue #131 - Better integration of overlays and connectors


#### Next (1.7.0)

- change syntax of css classnames from `_jsPlumb_****` to `jsplumb-***`
- drop VML support (IE < 9)
